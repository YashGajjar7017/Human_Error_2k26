# TODO: Implement CI/CD Pipelines

## Information Gathered
- Project is a Node.js application with Backend and Frontend directories, each with package.json.
- Existing pipeline files: .Pipelines.Yaml (empty), .pipelines/onebranch-pull-request.yml (empty), indicating Azure DevOps OneBranch setup.
- Docker Compose file present, suggesting containerization.
- No existing tests or build scripts specified, but assume npm install, build, test.

## Plan
- Update .pipelines/onebranch-pull-request.yml with a OneBranch pipeline for pull requests.
- Include stages: Install dependencies, build, test for Backend and Frontend, and build Docker images.
- Use Node.js 16 or latest, npm for package management.
- Trigger on pull requests to main branch.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- .pipelines/onebranch-pull-request.yml: Add full pipeline configuration.

## Followup Steps
- Commit and push changes to trigger the pipeline.
- Monitor pipeline runs for errors and adjust as needed.
- If deployment is required, add a separate pipeline or stage (e.g., for Azure).
- Test locally if possible before pushing.
