# Session Fix TODO

## Backend Session Controller Migration
- [x] Update Backend/controller/session.controller.js to use MongoDB Session model instead of file-based storage
- [x] Replace file operations with MongoDB queries for session CRUD operations
- [x] Update session creation, retrieval, joining, and management methods
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and data validation

## Frontend Session Controller Update
- [x] Update Frontend/controller/session.controller.js to use API calls instead of local file storage
- [x] Replace local session management with HTTP requests to backend session endpoints
- [x] Update all controller methods to use axios/fetch for API communication
- [x] Add proper error handling for API responses

## Authentication Integration
- [x] Ensure session routes use authentication middleware where required
- [x] Update session creation to require authenticated users
- [x] Add session token validation for protected session operations
- [x] Integrate user authentication with session participation

## Code Cleanup
- [x] Remove duplicate session management logic
- [x] Standardize session data structures between frontend and backend
- [x] Update any references to old file-based session storage
- [x] Ensure consistent session ID and join code generation

## Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test session creation, joining, and management
- [ ] Verify authentication integration works properly
- [ ] Test session persistence across server restarts
- [ ] Ensure frontend-backend session synchronization
